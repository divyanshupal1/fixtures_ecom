Checkout this README you'll get the steps.

i'll update this file. 

we are done with the installation of node now. 

next step is to run to app. 

first need to start the backend but as the backend is not deployed it'll not provide u the data.

next come out and navigate to the new-ecom folder

run using "npm run dev"

you'll get this link : http://localhost:3010/ -> Ctrl + Click

Main website will start running. 

now let's check for the admin. 

Navigate to admin -> run using "npm run dev"

again you'll get the link :   http://localhost:3000

you can login to the admin once the backend is deployed password: divyanshu , 12345
